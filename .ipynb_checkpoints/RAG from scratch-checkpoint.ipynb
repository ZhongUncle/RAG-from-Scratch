    "For example, you ask the LLM Model `What is FPGA?`. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the developer train model by something about FPGA or MCU, maybe it can answer something. But if not, the model will say something randomly. So today LLM, like ChatGPT, use internet or self-dataset to search what they don't \"remember\".\n",

    "Here also is problem, they don't know which is right, or they misunderstand by the volumious data. For a precise and reliable answer, RAG is all your need. \n",
    "\n",
    "You just need to prepare the data you think reliable, RAG will ask LLM with related-data (not all your data). And LLM also just answer your question by your data. \n",

    ">If you want to know more about it, please watch [Stanford CS224N: NLP with Deep Learning | Spring 2024 | Lecture 1 - Intro and Word Vectors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzpHeXVSC5I).

Unlike fixed‑logic ASICs, an FPGA can be programmed after manufacture by loading a configuration file (often called a *bitstream*) that tells the device how to interconnect its internal blocks to implement a desired digital circuit.\\n\\nKey points from the context:\\n\\n| Device name | Part number | Board name | FPGA family |\\n|-------------|-------------|------------|-------------|\\n| Sipeed Tang Nano 9K | **GW1NR‑LV9QN88PC6/I5** | tangnano9k | Gowin GW1N‑9C family |\\n| Sipeed Tang Nano 4K | GW1NSR‑LV4CQN48PC7/I6 | tangnano4k | Gowin GW1N‑4C family |\\n| Sipeed Tang Nano 1K | GW1NZ‑LV1QN48C6/I5 | tangnano1k | Gowin GW1N‑1C family |\\n| Sipeed Tang Nano | GW1N‑LV1QN48C6/I5 | tangnano | Gowin GW1N‑1C family |\\n| Seeed RUNBER | GW1N‑UV4LQ144C6/I5 | runber | Gowin GW1N‑4C family |\\n| @Disasm honeycomb | GW1NS‑UX2CQN48C5/I4 | honeycomb | Gowin GW1N‑4C family |\\n\\nTo use an FPGA:\\n\\n1. **Write HDL code** (e.g., Verilog or VHDL) that describes the desired logic.  \\n2. **Synthesize** the HDL to a netlist.  \\n3. **Place‑and‑route** (PnR) to generate a device‑specific configuration file (bitstream).  \\n4. **Pack** the bitstream for the target device (`gowin_pack -d GW1N‑9C -o top.fs test_pnr.json`).  \\n5. **Burn** the bitstream to the FPGA (e.g., via JTAG).  \\n\\nThe result is a programmable, reconfigurable digital system that can be tailored to many applications, from simple LED lighting (as shown in the example `top.v`) to complex processors, accelerators, or custom logic blocks.'"
